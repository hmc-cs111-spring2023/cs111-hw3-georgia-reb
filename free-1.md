# Free project 1

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

The need is to improve the ease of creating crochet patterns, and to allow
people who are currently working on a crochet project to easily keep track of
where they are in a project.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

In terms of creating a crochet pattern, it would be very benificial for a
pattern creater to have a programming language where they could easily add to
and manipulate the pattern, and then have an easy way to create an nice
pattern output. Then, for someone using the pattern it would be easy for them
to follow along. There could be both a PDF output, or an interative way to state
what progress you have made in the project while following the pattern. You
could also add your own notes, or edit the pattern yourself using thel anguage.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I like to crochet, and I find it difficult to keep track of where I am in my
project when I am either following a pattern, partially follwing a pattern
while making my own changes, or when I have created my own projects without a
pattern. I came up with this idea because I would love an easy way to create
crochet patterns, and I am already knowledgeable about this domain. It is also
a cool domain because it already has it's own abbreviations that could be used
in the language.

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Crochet pattern creation and use.

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

I imagine three different ways to interact with it. First, there would be the
coding that a user could do to create a pattern. Then, this coding could be
exported to either a PDF, or to an interactive program where the user gets to
keep track of what instruction they are on. I think the coding is the right
domain because it would allow the user to easily edit and create a pattern.
They could also add stylistic choices for the PDF output. The PDF output is
appropriate because that is how crochet patterns are currently circulated. And,
the interactive program that you load the code into would be very helpful for
people working on crochet projects.

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When the program runs, either a PDF or the interactive program would be created.

The program interacts with the user through the interactive system, where the
user can update what instruction they are on and add extra notes for each
instruction. They can also maybe scale the project with crochet hook and yarn
size.

An error that might occur would be if the number of stitches does not line up
on a project. This would be a compile time error, and would help the pattern
creator make their pattern functional.

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It would be easy to create crochet patterns with the variety of basic crochet
rules. It would be possible, but more difficult to define your own crochet
step that users could create. Maybe this could link to a youtube video with a
further description of how the step worked. It should be impossible or very
difficult to create something outside of the domain of crochet pattern making.

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There are crochet apps that help you work on a pattern, but I have not come
across any apps that help you create your own pattern. See link: https://hearthookhome.com/best-free-crochet-apps/

Additionally, there is crochet shorthand that people use for creating patterns,
but I think it would be very cool to transition this into a coding language.
That way people could create the pattern in the DSL, then have the DSL include
compile time errors, and allow for easy pattern PDF and interactive pattern
creation.

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I don't think that there would be many systems aspects of the language, as the
overall concept of crochet pattern creations is pretty free, there would not be
too many limitations. I think there would be lots of space to work on the design
both in the language creation and in the two output options.

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I think it depends on how much work is put into the interactive aspect of the
project. I imagine that someone could definitely create a very clean language
and the PDF output. There would then be room for the person to add the
interactive output, and maybe add more ways for the user to be creative in their
pattern creation.

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

I think it would be a good idea because the creator would get to do a variety
of different things, and the domain is already well defined with it's own
jargon and rules. Additionally, I was not able to find a program out there that
can be used to create crochet patterns seamlessly.

If the creator did not already understand what is and isn't possible when
crocheting, it would be difficult for them to decide on what the language's
rules are.
